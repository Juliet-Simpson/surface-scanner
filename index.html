                    <p class="">The UK Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) and Condition Monitoring (CM)
                        industry has invested in various defect testing techniques such as Eddy Current, LiDAR,
                        Ultrasonic, Dye Penetrant and Radiography to ensure the safety, quality and productivity for
                        major industries.</p>
                    <p>To keep large assets operational, companies rely on NDT and CM regimes to determine the need for
                        maintenance or repairs. This extends asset lifespan, reducing the need for capital investment to
                        replace integral equipment and prevents operational failures. Over 25,000 inspections are
                        carried out every day in the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>Aralia System Ltd&#8217;s (ASL) MPPS Illuminator is designed to be used as the ﬁrst step in the
                        NDT and CM process. Acting as a useful aid it can quickly and easily be used
                        on site for initial assessments to determine if additional resources or more rigorous testing is
                        required. Working in conjunction with a smartphone our low-cost device uses photometric stereo
                        to take detailed 3D colour images of a surface and any imperfections up to 5mm below the
                        surface.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="d-block d-md-none">How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>Our MPPS Illuminator is an extremely aﬀordable Photometric Stereo (PS) illumination device that interlocks with a smartphone enabling it to capture and process images revealing high-resolution and detailed 3D colour images of a surface and any imperfections up to 5mm below the surface.</p>
                    <p>Our device works &#8217;out of the box&#8217; with minimal training and all necessary software is easy to download. The images can be processed locally on the phone, via the cloud  and transmitted oﬀ site for a remote assessment by expert review or automated via Machine Learning which is critical during  pandemics  such as COVID-19.  The simplicity and low price point of our innovative MPPS Illuminator enables high volumes to be   readily distributed whenever necessary. Our solution also includes facilities for archiving, displaying and processing images through the application of machine learning.</p>
